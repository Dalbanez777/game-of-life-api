# Game of Life API (.NET 8)

##  Problem Description

Implement Conwayâ€™s Game of Life as a RESTful API.  
The Game of Life is a zero-player game that evolves based on its initial state using simple rules on a grid of cells. The goal is to simulate the next generation(s) of a given board configuration.

##  Steps to Run Locally

### Prerequisites:
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- VS Code or any C#-compatible editor
- `curl` or Postman for testing API endpoints

### 1. Clone and navigate to the project:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd GameOfLife_NET8_WithSolution

### 2. Run the application:

dotnet run --project src/GameOfLife.csproj

### 3. Run Tests

dotnet test

The API will be running at:
https://localhost:5001 (HTTPS) or
http://localhost:5000 (HTTP)

### 4. Swagger UI:

Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:5000/swagger

Explanation of the Solution and Thought Process
	â€¢	The project follows a clean architecture structure: src/ for app logic and tests/ for tests.
	â€¢	GameOfLifeService implements the main game logic including board validation and state transitions.
	â€¢	State is stored in-memory using a Dictionary<Guid, Board> to simulate persistence.
	â€¢	Controllers are thin and delegate logic to services.
	â€¢	Swagger is integrated for API discoverability and easy testing.
	â€¢	xUnit is used for unit testing core logic without relying on the API layer.

    Assumptions:
	â€¢	All boards are rectangular and contain binary cell values (0 or 1).
	â€¢	Input data is well-formed JSON and validated by the model.
	â€¢	No persistence to disk or database â€” all data is in-memory.

Trade-offs:
	â€¢	In-memory storage is fast and simple but not persistent across restarts.
	â€¢	No API authentication or rate limiting â€” itâ€™s focused purely on functionality.
	â€¢	Performance is acceptable for small/medium boards but would need optimization for very large grids or high concurrency.

    ## Scalability Considerations

- In-memory storage can be replaced with a distributed cache (e.g., Redis) for multi-instance scaling.
- API is stateless and can be load-balanced easily.
- Logic is abstracted to support swapping in a database (e.g., MongoDB or SQL).
- Future versions can add board compression for reduced memory footprint on large grids.

## Designed for Extensibility

- Easily extendable to support user sessions or multiplayer patterns
- Replace in-memory board storage with persistent databases (e.g., SQL, NoSQL)
- REST endpoints can be expanded to include board history, analytics, or even live visualizations

Endpoints Table

Method | Endpoint                  | Description                       | Request Body   | Response
------ | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------
GET    | /api/GameOfLife/status    | Check if the API is running       | None           | 200 OK with text
POST   | /api/GameOfLife/save      | Save a new board                  | JSON Board     | 200 OK with Guid
POST   | /api/GameOfLife/next      | Compute next state of a board     | JSON Board     | 200 OK with Board
GET    | /api/GameOfLife/{id}      | Get a previously saved board by ID| None           | 200 OK with Board or 404


Scalability Considerations

This project was designed with scalability in mind:
	â€¢	Stateless Services: The GameOfLifeService is stateless and thread-safe, allowing the application to scale horizontally across multiple instances without synchronization issues.
	â€¢	Swappable Storage Layer: The current in-memory ConcurrentDictionary storage can easily be replaced with distributed caching solutions (e.g., Redis) or persistent databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
	â€¢	Lightweight Controllers: Controller logic is thin and delegates processing to services, promoting better separation of concerns and easier load balancing.
	â€¢	Future-ready Middleware: The ASP.NET Core pipeline can be extended with middleware for rate-limiting, caching, authentication, and telemetry to support larger deployments.

These considerations make the application suitable for containerization (e.g., Docker) and deployment in cloud environments like Azure, AWS, or GCP.

### Docker Support

You can run the Game of Life API inside a Docker container using the included `Dockerfile`.

#### ðŸ”§ Build the image

```bash
docker build -t gameoflife-api .
```

#### â–¶Run the container

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:80 --name gameoflife-container gameoflife-api
```

Then visit: [http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html](http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html)

#### Stop & Remove the container

```bash
docker stop gameoflife-container
docker rm gameoflife-container
```

> Make sure nothing else is using port `5000`, or map to a different one with `-p 5001:80`
